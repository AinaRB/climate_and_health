# Taking the temperature of our cities: A story from Sao Paulo, Brazil

Humans are *homeotherms* species. This means that for the correct functioning of our body, we need our body temperature to be within a certain range regardless of the temperature in the environment. For humans, this temperature is within a degree or two of 37 degrees Celsius (98.6 degrees Fahrenheit). If this temperature is not met, our survival is compromise, affecting our vital organs and leading to health complications or in the most extreme cases, death.

So, it is clear now that it is essential for us to maintain this temperature rather constant. Then the question is, how do we do that? And the answer is *thermoregulation*. This physiologic mechanism allows our body to internally modulate its temperature. It comprises several different processes that are activated when our body temperature diverts too much from the optimal one. Sweating, for example, is one of such processes. When our temperature increases, our body starts sweating, a form of evapotranspiration, which allows us to expel heat from the body. When our body drops too much, on the other hand, we start shivering which produces localized heat, slightlty raising our body temperautre. But as you can imagine, and have probably experienced several times, these processes are not enough when deviations from the optimal temperature are too large. In those situations, external factors start playing a role. According to Hondulas and colleagues, these external or non-physiological elements can be classified in: behavioural, infrastructura or technological.

## What do we mean by adaptation?
What we saw above are acute responses to external temperature changes. But what about long term shifts to the temperatures we are exposed? Say you grew up in Bahamas and you are moving to Helsinki in Finland. Will your body react the same way as that of someone living in Helsinki all their lives? Probably your gut feeling tells you that the answer is no. And you are right. We know from several studies that people develop mechanisms that are turned to the usual temperatures they are exposed to. Which makes total sense, right? If I live in a cold place, my metabolism, behaviours, and the infrastructure I have access to, will be tuned to the needs of that specific place. I will not, for example walk around in a swimsuit (behaviors), nor have the air conditioning on (infrastructure) and my body will for sure, not be sweating. This iswhat we call *adaptation*. 

But what happens if it is not me who moves but the environment that chaages? This is exactly what climate change is. We have already seen temperatures increasing in comparison to pre-industrial times and climate patterns have been reported to change, with some areas being more affected than others. And on top of that, our societies are constantly changing and evolving; new technology is developed, knowledge about the risks and prevention options is increasing, access to infrastructure and facilities changes, and so on. As we have seen above, all this shape our response or *adaptation* to temperature of our environment. 



## How can we measure it?
